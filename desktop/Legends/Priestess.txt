Legend of the Tiny Drug Priestess

There is this legend of a town no one knows that exists
on no map with a church praising a name of a man who 
may never truly exist, with a Priestess, Grand Priestess
at that, who owns all the worlds most exotic drugs. 
Why she owned these drugs? Because she feels her lord 
Ryan demands it despite knowing her lord Ryan does not 
give two shits. But then again, this could just be a 
Grand Priestess Fairy with a marijuana farm and nothing
else, But this isn't the legend and therefore is wrong.
