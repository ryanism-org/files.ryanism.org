Legend of the Heavy Drinker

Within this bar in this town, there is a legend of a 
man who drinks what was originally thought impossible.
Getting horny by the southern workers, they ask your 
Yale, Yellow Snow (Urine Flavor), and Spitting Cum Jars.
It is assumed that this thing is gay and racist, But 
this isn't the legend and therefore is wrong.
