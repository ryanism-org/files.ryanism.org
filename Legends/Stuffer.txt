Legend of the Cum Stuffer

Do not let the name of those legend fool you, 
for it is short and to the point. There is this man
with cum jars, but oh no, he is not the sucker, his 
victims are. This man does not know the damage he holds
and what he can do with this, but he does own an 
irresistible urge to stuff what he knows as mysterious
liquid down peoples throats and stealing their Gas 
Station Deeds. But then again, this could've been a 
fatal mistake inside one random bar by a misinformed 
dragonborn, But this isn't the legend and therefore is 
wrong.
