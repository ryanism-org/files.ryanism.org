Legend of the Cloth Rapist

There exists a man like no other with the capabilities
to rape people without the need to remove clothes. 
His actions scar all those who hear this tale and all 
those who have witnessed it, but it may have awakened 
something else in himself or others who have heard the 
tale as this fate has been noticed across the map in 
most cities. But then again, this could've been a 
dragonborn trying to help his friends by giving this 
extremely strong man a reason to need therapy and 
instead, awakening more fetishes he could not have 
possibly known he has, But this isn't the legend and 
therefore is wrong.
