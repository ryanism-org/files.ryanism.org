Legend of the Kool-Aid Paladin

There exists a holy paladin like no other, a man 
following and doing the bid of Ryanism while also 
smashing through anything he sees and screaming 
"OH YEAH!" in a dumb but nostalgic voice. He spreads
Ryanism to those he deems worthy while cutting down 
those who do not, and those who make fun of his Kool-Aid
Man impression. But then again, this could just be some
idiot who had the bright idea to run into a enemy base
screaming "OH YEAH!" in that dumb but nostalgic voice,
just to end up mind controlled and turn on those he once
called friends, and that dragonborn that hates all their
guts, But this isn't the legend and therefore is wrong.
